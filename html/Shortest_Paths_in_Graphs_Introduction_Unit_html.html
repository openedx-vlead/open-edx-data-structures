In this experiment, we look at the weighted version of Breadth First Search(BFS). In BFS, we have measured <i>ds(v)</i> in terms of 
number of edges in the path from the starting vertex <i>s</i> to <i>v</i>. This is equivalent to assuming that each edge in the graph 
has equal (unit) weight.
Here we consider a more general setting, where we are given a weighted graph <i>G = (V, E, W)</i> with a weight function <i>W : E â€“&gt; R</i>.
A typical example is Road networks, where junctions can be treated as vertices and roads as edges with distance as its corresponding 
weights. A typical problem is to find the shortest distance between two junctions <i>u</i> and <i>v</i>, where the distance is the 
sum of weights of edges along a <i>u</i> --- <i>v</i> path.
