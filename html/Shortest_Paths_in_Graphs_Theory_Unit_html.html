<h3>Bellman-Ford</h3>
<p>Lets look at a simple method, by extending the approach used in BFS. We define <i>ds(v)</i> as the minimum cost of a path from <i>s</i> to <i>v</i>. Initially <i>ds(v) = &infin;</i> for all vertices <i>v</i> except <i>s</i>, and <i>ds(s) = 0</i>. Recall that in BFS, we say a node is finished if it is in the queue. If we directly enqueue all the neighbors <i>v</i> of a vertex <i>u</i> in to the queue and mark them as finished, it may not work for this weighted version. There can be another path from <i>u</i> to <i>v</i> with more number of edges but with smaller cost. So, we may have to change <i>ds(v)</i> while <i>v</i> is still in queue. If you consider the same argument using paths with more edges but with smaller cost, even this may not work. We may need to update <i>ds(v)</i> even when <i>v</i> is not in queue and can do so as long as there are changes to some <i>ds(v)</i>. This suggests that we need not have a queue and as there are only a finite number of edges in any shortest path, the updations will stop eventually. This is the Bellman-Ford single source shortest path algorithm and is descibed below.</p>
<p><i> <b>Algorithm Bellman-Ford(G,S)</b> <br /> &nbsp;for all vertices v do <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ds(v) = &infin;; from(v) = NIL;<br /> &nbsp;end-for<br /> &nbsp;for n-1 iterations do<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for each edge (v,w) do <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if ds(w) &gt; ds(v) + W(v,w) then<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ds(w) = ds(v) + W(v,w); from(w) = v;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end-if<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end-for<br /> &nbsp;end-for<br /> <b>End-Bellman-Ford</b><br /> <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></i></p>
<p>The algorithm requires <i>O(mn)</i> time, where <i>n</i> is the number of vertices and <i>m</i> is the number of edges. For each of the <i>n</i>-1 iterations, we consider each edge once. <br /><br /></p>
<h3>Dijkstra</h3>
<p>The time taken by the Bellman-Ford algorithm is too high because of repeatedly considering edges and updating <i>ds(v)</i> possibly many times. We need to know when to stop updating <i>ds(v)</i> for a vertex <i>v</i> and we will now see a method which captures this and improves the runtime. A vertex <i>v</i> is done, when no further shorter path can be found to it from <i>s</i> i.e., when <i>ds(v)</i> can no longer decrease. We consider a few vertices, say <i>S</i>, are done. A vertex with the smallest <i>ds</i> value among the vertices in <i>V(G) \ S</i> can no longer improve its <i>ds</i> value. This is because, any more change would involved using at least one more additional edge. This suggests that the vertex with the smallest <i>ds</i> value can be moved to the set <i>S</i>. Initially, only the starting vertex <i>s</i> is in the set <i>S</i> and we incrementally populate <i>S</i> with more vertices. We can proceed iteratively and in each iteration, move a vertex with the least <i>ds</i> value to set <i>S</i>. When we move a vertex <i>v</i> to <i>S</i>, the neighbors of <i>v</i> may find a better path from <i>s</i>, so we have to update <i>ds(w)</i> for neighbors <i>w</i> of <i>v</i>, if necessary. The only steps left to take care is, finding a vertex in <i>V(G) \ S</i> that has the least <i>ds</i> value. Also, we have to update the <i>ds</i> values of vertices in <i>V(G) \ S</i> if needed. This is very similar to Prims algorithm for finding a Minimum Spanning Tree, except that the costs <i>ds</i> are added with the edge weights for updation. We can use a Binary Heap here. This is the Dijkstras single source shortest path algorithm and is described below.</p>
<p><i> <b>Algorithm Dijkstra(G,s)</b> <br /> &nbsp;for all vertices v do<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ds(v) = infin;; from(v) = NIL;<br /> &nbsp;end-for<br /> &nbsp;ds(s) = 0;<br /> &nbsp;S = &Phi;<br /> &nbsp;for n iterations do<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;v = the vertex with the least ds() value among V \ S;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add v to S<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for each neighbor w of v in V \ S do<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d(w) = min { d(w), d(v) + W(v,w) }<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end-for<br /> &nbsp;end-for<br /> <b>End-Dijkstra</b><br /> <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></i></p>
<p>We will analyze the algorithm when using a binary heap. A binary heap is built out of the n nodesa and there are <i>n</i> DeleteMin() operations and at most <i>m</i> DecreaseKey() operations. Each DeleteMin() takes <i>O(log n)</i> time and each DecreaseKey() operation takes <i>O(log n)</i> time. So, the total time is <i>O((n+m)log n)</i>.</p>
