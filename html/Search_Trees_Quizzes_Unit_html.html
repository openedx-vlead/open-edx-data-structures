<li><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6em;">What is the maximum height of a binary search tree on n nodes. What is the minimum height of a binary search tree on n nodes.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6em;">What is the maximum height of a binary search tree if every internal node at level l have both their children before any node at level l+1 has some children.</span></li>

<h3>Difficult Problems</h3>

<li><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6em;">Many problems do not require the full repertoire of dictionary operations but only a subset. Consdier the subset of operations: insert(), and DeleteMin(). In this case, it is not required to have a binary search tree and we can think of ways to support these two oeprations efficiently. Here is a possible way.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6em;">Use the binary tree described in the third question above. Use the invariant that the value at any node is at most the value of both of its children. In this data structure, where is the minimum element?</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6em;">Suppose you add one more element to the existing tree above. Where should you first place it? How do you repair the invaraint if required? What is the runtime of this operation?</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6em;">Extend your solution above to also the DeleteMin() operation. What is the runtime of your operation?</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6em;">How can you use your above data structure to sort n data items. What is the runtime of your solution?</span></li>
