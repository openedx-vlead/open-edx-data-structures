<h3> Easy Problems</h3>
<ol>
<li><p> Modify the operation delete in a binary search tree so that
the maximum node in the right subtree is used as the replacement
node. </p></li>
<li>
<p> What is the maximum height of a binary search tree on n nodes.
What is the minimum height of a binary search tree on n nodes.</p></li>
<li>
<p> What is the maximum height of a binary search tree if every
internal node at level l have both their children before any node
at level l+1 has some children. </p></li>
</ol>
<h3> Difficult Problems</h3>
<ol><li>
<p> Many problems do not require the full repertoire of dictionary
operations but only a subset. Consdier the subset of operations:
insert(), and DeleteMin(). In this case, it is not required to
have a binary search tree and we can think of ways to support
these two oeprations efficiently. Here is a possible way. </p></li>
<li>
<p>Use the binary tree described in the third question above. Use the
invariant that the value at any node is at most the value of both
of its children. In this data structure, where is the minimum
element? </p></li>
<li>
<p>Suppose you add one more element to the existing tree above. Where
should you first place it? How do you repair the invaraint if
required? What is the runtime of this operation?</p></li>
<li>
<p> Extend your solution above to also the DeleteMin() operation.
What is the runtime of your operation?</p></li>
<li>
<p> How can you use your above data structure to sort n data
items. What is the runtime of your solution?</p></li></ol>
<!--
<p>&#149;&nbsp;AVL TressA binary search tree satisfying the search invariant, and the height invariant
is called an AVL tree. These are named after after its inventors, Adelson Velskii and Landis.
An insertion/removal can violate the height invariant and  how to maintain the invariant after an insert/remove.
<p>&#149;&nbsp;B+ tree : Instead of a binary tree, imagine a k-ary search tree.The k subtrees of a node shall be k-ary trees so that the values in tree Ti are between Ti-1 and Ti+1.Generalizes a binary search tree.
<p>&#149;&nbsp;In a splay tree, during every operation, including a search(), the current (serach) tree is modified.The item searched is made as the root of the tree.During this process, other nodes also change their height.
