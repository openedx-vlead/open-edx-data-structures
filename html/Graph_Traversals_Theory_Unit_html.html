<h3>Breadth First Search (BFS)</h3>
<p>BFS is similar to level order traversal in a tree, where we visit vertices in a level by level order. We specify a starting vertex <i>S</i> and start visiting vertices of the graph <i>G</i> from the vertex <i>S</i>. As a general graph can have cycles, we may visit the same vertex more than once. To solve this, we also maintain the state of each vertex. A vertex can be in one of three states, VISITED, NOT_VISITED, IN_PROCESS. The basic idea of breadth first search is to find the least number of edges between <i>S</i> and any other vertex in <i>G</i>. Starting from <i>S</i>, we visit vertices of distance <i>k</i> before visiting any vertex of distance <i>k+1</i>. For that purpose, define <i>ds(v)</i> to be the least number of edges between <i>S</i> and <i>v</i> in <i>G</i>. So, for vertices <i>v</i> that are not reachable from <i>S</i> we can have <i>ds(v)</i> = &infin;. We can use a queue to store vertices in progress.</p>
<p>We also a maintain <i>from[u]</i> for each of the vertex <i>u</i>, which denotes the vertex that discovered <i>u</i>. This information can be used to define the predecessor subgraph of <i>G</i>, which has all edges <i>(from[u],u)</i>. These edges are called as tree edges. For a tree edge <i>(u, v), ds(v) = ds(u) + 1</i>. All other edges are called non-tree edges and are further classified as back edges and cross edges. A non-tree edge (u, v) is called as a back edge if <i>ds(v) &lt; ds(u)</i>, meaning <i>u</i> can be reached from <i>S</i> via <i>v</i>, but there is yet another shortest path through path <i>u</i> can be reached from <i>S</i>. An edge <i>(u, v) </i> is called a cross edge if d(v) &le; d(u) + 1.</p>
<p><i> <b>Procedure BFS(G)</b> <br /> &nbsp;for each v in V(G) do<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; from[v] = NIL; state[v] = NOT_VISITED; d(v) = &infin;<br /> &nbsp;end-for<br /><br /> &nbsp;ds[S] = 0; state[S] = IN_PROCESS; from[s] = NIL;<br /> &nbsp;Q = EMPTY; Q.Enqueue(S);<br /><br /> &nbsp;While Q is not empty do<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; v = Q.Dequeue();<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; for each neighbour w of v do<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if state[w] == NOT_VISITED then<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; state[w] = IN_PROCESS; from[w] = v; ds[w] = ds[v] + 1; Q.Enqueue(w);<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; end-if<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; state[v] = VISITED<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; end-for<br /> &nbsp;end-while<br /> <b>End-BFS</b> <br /> </i></p>
<p><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Runtime:</span></i> Each vertex enters the queue at most once and each edge is considered only once. Therefore, runtime of BFS is <i>O(m+n)</i>, where <i>n</i> is the number of vertices and <i>m</i> is the number of edges in <i>G</i>. <br /><br /></p>
<h3>Depth First Search (DFS)</h3>
<p>The idea of DFS is to start from a specified start vertex <i>S</i> and explore from <i>S</i> as deep as possible. We go from <i>S</i>, to one of its neighbors <i>x</i>, to a neighbor of <i>x</i>, and so on. We stop when there are no new neighbors to explore from a given vertex. If all vertices are not visited, pick another start vertex from such vertices. We have to keep track of the state of a vertex and similar to BFS, a vertex can be in three states: VISITED, NOT_VISITED, IN_PROCESS. We also a maintain <i>from[u], d[u], f[u]</i> for each of the vertex <i>u</i>, which denotes the vertex that discovered <i>u</i>, the discovery time of <i>u</i> and the finish time <i>u</i>.</p>
<p><i> <b>Procedure Explore(v)</b><br /> &nbsp; d[v] = cur_time;<br /> &nbsp; cur_time = cur_time + 1;<br /> &nbsp; for each neighbor w of v <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; if state(w) == NOT_VISITED then<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; state(w) = IN_PROCESS;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Explore(w);<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; end-if<br /> &nbsp; end-for<br /> &nbsp; state(v) = VISITED;<br /> &nbsp; f[v] = cur_time;<br /> &nbsp; cur_time = cur_time + 1;<br /> <b>End-Explore</b><br /> <br /> <b>Procedure DFS(G)</b><br /> &nbsp; cur_time = 0<br /> &nbsp; for v = 1 to n do<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; if state(v) == NOT_VISITED then<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; state(v) = IN_PROCESS;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Explore(v);<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; end-if<br /> &nbsp; end-for<br /> <b>End-DFS</b><br /> </i></p>
<p><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Runtime:</span></i> Explore() is called for each vertex exactly once and each edge is considered only once. Therefore, runtime of DFS is <i>O(m+n)</i>, where <i>n</i> is the number of vertices and <i>m</i> is the number of edges in <i>G</i>. <br /><br /></p>
<p>Classification of edges, based on Depth First traversal is as follows</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tree Edges</span> : All edges <i>(from[u],u)</i> are called as tree edges and define a dfs tree, a subgraph of <i>G</i>.
<ul>
<li><i>An edge (u,v)</i> is a tree edge if <i>from[v] = u</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Back Edges</span> : A non-tree edge <i>(u, v)</i> is called as a back edge if <i>v</i> is an ancestor of <i>u</i> in the dfs tree. <i>u</i> can be reached from <i>v</i> using tree edges, but there an edge from <i>u</i> to <i>v</i> also.
<ul>
<li><i>An edge (u,v)</i> is a back edge if [d(u), f(u)] is a subinterval of [d(v), f(v)]</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Forward Edges</span> : A non-tree edge <i>(u, v)</i> is called as a forward edge if <i>v</i> is a descendant of <i>u</i> in the dfs tree. <i>v</i> can be reached from <i>u</i> using tree edges, but there an edge from <i>u</i> to <i>v</i> also.
<ul>
<li><i>An edge (u,v)</i> is a forward edge if [d(v), f(v)] is a subinterval of [d(u), f(u)].</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cross Edges</span> : Non-tree edges <i>(u, v)</i> where <i>u</i> and <i>v</i> do not share any ancestor/descendant relationship are called cross edges.
<ul>
<li><i>An edge (u,v)</i> is a cross edge if the two intervals [d(u), f(u)] and [d(v), f(v)] do not overlap.</li>
</ul>
