In this experiment, we will see a famous problem in graphs, finding the Minimum Spanning Tree. Let <i>G = (V, E, W)</i> be 
a weighted graph. Find a subgraph <i>G'</i> of <i>G</i> that is connected and has the smallest cost, where cost is defined as 
the sum of the edge weights of all edges in <i>G'</i>. Observe that if <i>G'</i> has a cycle, we can remove one of the edges
along a cycle and still the resultant graph will remain connected and has smaller cost than <i>G'</i>. Hence, <i>G'</i> cannot be
have a cycle and as it has to be connected, <i>G'</i> must be a tree. We define <i>G'</i> as a spanning subgraph of <i>G</i> iff
<i>V(G) = V(G')</i> and a spanning subgraph that is also a tree is called a spanning tree of <i>G</i>. Our aim is to find a spanning tree
of <i>G</i> that has the least cost and such a spanning tree is called as minimum spanning tree (MST) of <i>G</i>.
